# elastic-mtrupdate

by Thomas Tong ([thomastong.me](http://thomastong.me/))

Following a [workshop](https://github.com/elastic/hkoscon16) of ELK stack (Elastic search, Logstash, Kibana) in [HKOS Conf 2016](http://2016.opensource.hk/), I decided to try this on twitter [@mtrupdate](https://twitter.com/mtrupdate).

MTR Service Update ([@mtrupdate](https://twitter.com/mtrupdate)) is a voluntary service driven by Hong Kong MTR staffs, to report up-to-date railway disruptions information to its everyday users. Although Hong Kong MTR has an official App to broadcast these incidents, its long response time have made this non-official channel widely popular.

After collecting the tweets, statistics regarding service disruptions can be computed and visualized.

~~This project is currently hosted on Azure:~~

- ~~Kibana: (http://mtr.eastasia.cloudapp.azure.com:5601/)~~
- ~~Elastic Search (http://mtr.eastasia.cloudapp.azure.com/twitter_elk_mtrupdate/_search/) (GET only)~~

Screenshots will be uploaded from time to time.
