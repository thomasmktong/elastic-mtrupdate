# elastic-mtrupdate

Following a [workshop](https://github.com/elastic/hkoscon16) of ELK stack (elastic, logstash, kibana) in [HKOS Conf 2016](http://2016.opensource.hk/), I decided to try this on twitter [@mtrupdate](https://twitter.com/mtrupdate).


MTR Service Update ([@mtrupdate](https://twitter.com/mtrupdate)) is a voluntary service driven by Hong Kong MTR staffs, to report up-to-date railway disruptions information to its everyday users. Although Hong Kong MTR has official channels to broadcast these incidents, its speed and information completeness have made non-official channels widely popular.


Below are some data extractions done after running the stack for 3 days. Screenshots will be uploaded from time to time.
